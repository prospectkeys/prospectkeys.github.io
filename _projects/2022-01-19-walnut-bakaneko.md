Last summer, I was new to the hobby and my thought was "I could design a tray mount keyboard". It had already been done but I had a woodmaker in mind whose work would make for a beautiful keyboard. I met him in Park City at "Park Silly Sunday". His stuff looked like this:

I had owned a wooden tray-mount for one of my first purchases in the hobby but it wasn't anything special. It was this wooden GK-64 keyboard. A lot of my first experimenting with different PCBs, switches, plates, case materials and more, I did on tray-mount 60 percents. It was a great experience, getting to learn the ways of making a keyboard sound and feel better. However, once I tried the Bakaneko, tray mount in the 60% form factor was spoiled for me. Instead of building an artisan tray mount, I'd try one with a gummy o-ring. Since the Bakaneko was open source, it was the perfect ready-to-go design to try some things with.

I worked with a local woodworker to get a prototype milled out of walnut. It looked a lot like my GK-64, pretty plain and uninteresting. However, with a little bit of flair with the Geekark Tea set, we had a nice looking prototype (according to myself and a few friends' preference, though certainly not everyone's). It sounded really interesting with the brass plate and 50a strength gummy O-ring. I was pleasantly surprised as the sound was unlike other keyboards. It makes sense, as I am not aware of any other wooden Bakaneko60 keyboards. See the sound test below and judge for yourself.
