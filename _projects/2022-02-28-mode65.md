The Mode SixtyFive is either essentially Top-mount (with rubber isolation inserts) or "Stack mount", which is basically achieved by using the Silicone case dampener, which fits right against the bottom of the PCB. Stack mount relies on pressure from below the PCB by the silicone, whereas top mount obviously supports the PCB and plate from the top.

What I found to be the best option for me was screwing in the plate to the top-case with the rubber sleeves over the divets that are used for the mounting, and also to use the Silicone. This will largely be personal preference. I didn't find the Mode SixtyFive to be very flexy without the Silicone dampener underneath, so using it to tighten up the sound did not detract from an otherwise flexy board in my case. Some people will like the resonance the Mode produces with no dampener but it wasn't for me.

The flexiest configuration I tried was with the half-plate, and a PCB with alphas that flex independently from the mods. I was not a fan of the typing feel. The bounce wasn't a bad thing but it's very inconsistent by design, which some people will not mind but I could not get behind. The center alphas flex the most and the outer alphas flex almost none. 

The second most flexible config I tried was the POM full plate, without the silicone, but I still noticed some resonance. The flexiblity here came from the POM material being very soft and flexible. The POM, to my ears, muted a lot of the switch sound, and this just made the resonance even more annoying, since there was less switch noise to overpower it.

Reluctantly, I used all the foam and silicone, with FR4 plate, which doesn't flex at all but feels and sounds the best, and for me was worth the compromise of the little bit of flexibility. It still feels softer than my Tofu as it should, and isn't too stiff for long typing sessions. 

Still, I prefer a Gummy O-ring in a Bakaneko to the Mode for sound and feel, at a third of the price. The Bakaneko lacks some high end features like CNC milling but it's still a better value than the Mode. The Mode is a good board in general, and about average for value for money. I would keep in mind that you won't like this if you don't like top mount or stack mount. This should be obvious, but this will not flex like your gasket mount or gummy o-ring boards.
