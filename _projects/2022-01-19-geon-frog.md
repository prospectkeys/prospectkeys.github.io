## Frog TKL by GeonWorks
###### EPBT Grand Tour
###### Penguin Switches by Kinetic Labs Lubed with 205g0
###### Aluminum Plate

This has been my daily driver for a few weeks. I was skeptical when I heard mixed reviews on the Frog but I am so glad I went for it. The Penguin switches are the sweet spot for tactility for me and the Aluminum plate with loads of flex cuts sounds great and even across the board. One of the criticisms has been the space-bar but I am happy with the space bar on the Frog. It's not as solid as the Mode 65 spacebar but it sounds fine. Altogether a solid pickup, if you can get it in stock. It's called a budget build by many people in the hobby. I leave it up to you whether you consider this budget (it's about $400 with shipping) as everyone has different financial situations. Yes, there are many good boards in this price range and I'd consider it midrange price-wise but you can't beat buying an in-stock board and avoiding the group buy lead times.
