## Prime_E
###### DSA PBT White Blanks, Raeds with 205g0, POM Plate

This was my first foray into non-traditional layouts. I wanted something that was not super expensive since I didn't know if I would like it. In hindsight it was a little too different for me and going with a traditional Alice style layout would have been the better move. Instead, I got this little stacked acrylic 40% ergo style Prime_e from PrimeKB. It went into stock and I figured I'd give it a try for I believe about 125 USD. The first challenge was finding keycaps for all the mods. They are all nontraditional sizes, smaller than a regular modifier keycap. To give a better idea of this, only the spacebars had need of stabilizers. 

I knew I wouldn't be able to type my regular speed on this keyboard but I never did get used to the layout. Given a bit more time, I probably would but I just don't really see a compelling reason to do it, other than perhaps using it as a travel keyboard. The issue, though is that when I am used to a layout, let's say the Prime_E's odd layout, it messes with my ability to type on a normal 60%. Therefore, it has sat on my shelf, and not seen much use. One of these days if I'm bored and needing a project, maybe it would be something to try and get used to using.

I did like the POM plate on this board. It sounded very thocky, with the Raed switches' long pole banging away and the acrylic construction of the case. From time to time I use and then get frustrated with this guy here. This might be the proof I need to avoid spending custom money on an Alice style keyboard. It gives me pause, which is a good thing to have in this hobby where an impulisve decision can leave a poor man (me) without this month's spending money. God help me.
