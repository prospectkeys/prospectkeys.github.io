The silent Tofu is just a green Tofu 60 keyboard I have made totally silent. It has all the foams, including plate foam, switch foam, multiple layers of drawer liner foam in the base. The foams are there to attempt to asborb as much sound as possible. The switch is Durock silent T1s, since I am a tactile preferer. I preferred these to the Silent Boba U4s. They felt more like a normal T1 than the U4s felt like a normal U4T, if that makes any sense. I put headphones on and I couldn't easily tell these were silent. They almost don't feel silent, and have very little mush at the bottom that seemed more present in the Bobas. 

Nevertheless both are very quiet. With the Durocks, all you hear is an almost inaudible thump. Being in a Tofu, the typing feel is very stiff, but I used a polycarbonate plate, as they tend to be quieter than metal or FR4 (obviously this isn't an absolute rule). Between POM and PC, I am not sure which is quieter, if any. That is something I'll have to test. Using such quiet switches, it might not matter which plastic plate I chose. It does feel slightly less like a brick with the PC plate making it just a tiny bit more soft and bearable. It's not ideal, and a tray mount is a tray mount. I prefer softer typing feel. As for sound though, I'm very surprised how quiet it could get and still feel like a full tactile switch.  

The Tofu is obviously very simple, but looks good. It's minimal and seems well anodized, in the dark green color, I'm a big fan of the finish actually. It's unapologetically sharp at the edges. It's a rectangle wedge that really doesn't get simpler. This is the basic bitch of Keyboards but if you are just looking for something simple then its simplicity won't bother you. It has a seamless design, which I can appreciate after hating the Tofu HHKB, and thank god it has a discrete plate unlike the HHKB.

It gets a little more flex and play if you dremel off the middle standoffs like I did and mount the PCB between two silicone O-rings, like I did. I have some plan to use my Weirdflex Wilba PCB to let the middle flex.
