This came to my attention as a fan of Divinikey as a vendor where I could get a nice variety of switches, lube, films, accessories and more. Divinikey is a stateside company and so its shipping is very reasonable for people in the US compared to KBDFans, some of whose merchandise Divinikey sells as a stateside proxy. I had been very impressed with their service and quality products, so when they made their own switch, and it hit a lot of my preferences out of the gate, I got a batch. 

They are manufactured by Tecsee and come with a 67g spring. They have a long pole stem, with Nylon bottom and polycarb top. They have a really nice tactile bump, that is sharp but not unpleasantly so. Having tried the Naevies, also from Tecsee but lighter on both bump and spring, these are heavier switches but in my opinion very satisfying to type on, more than the Naevies. The bump isn't as rounded or as fatiguing, it seems to me, as the Boba U4Ts. The switch is on the clackier side, and the long pole makes for a crisp bottom out, making for such a satisfying feel.
