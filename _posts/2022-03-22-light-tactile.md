As a keyboard enthusiast who spends too much time thinking about, buying, and modding in the search for the perfect switch. As anyone who has had a similar search probably knows there is no such thing as a personal perfect switch. You hopefully get to the ballpark of switches you prefer, or multiple ballparks of switches for different tasks. It's just part of the hobby that you will eventually get tired of things and feel the urge to try one of the onslaught of new switches that are constantly coming out. Tastes are always changing at least for me. It's nice when I find a switch I enjoy using. For me, the most enjoyable switch is not always the one you type fastest or most accurately with.

I've always been a "tactile-gang" member since I joine the hobby. My phases of trying linear switches never lasted. It felt like something was missing, and I came away feeling unsatisfied. On the other hand, hugely tactile switches, like the Boba U4T (big rounded bump) and Kailh Box Royals (sharp clifflike top-travel bump), for me, were too far in the other direction. Typing became laborious and not ideal for typing fast. The Box Royal in particular, is the worst offender in this regard. The feel is overwhelming for my fingers, and the sound is too loud and harsh. On the other hand, the Boba U4T is a very nice sounding switch, and it's more pleasurable to type on due to the smoother and more rounded bump, and more satisfying thump on bottom out. The problem is immediately apparent with the Box Royals but more gradually apparent for the Boba U4T. 

For me, as an MX-style switch with a relatively rounded bump increases in size of the bump, my accuracy increases. After a certain point, though, my speed decreases, and the U4T is past that point. This is on the somewhat subjective spectrum from linear to too tactile to even use. After a certain point (not necessarily the point where my typing speed starts to decrease), the switch becomes tiring to use for long periods of time relative to other switches with the spring weight held constant. 

The Durock T1, a commonly used tactile, seems to be about average for what some keyboard enthusiasts expect from a tactile switch. It's JWK's (and Durock's) flagship tactile, so to speak. It's considered a good switch at its mid-tier price of around 55 cents per switch. On the other hand, Cherry MX Browns at the time of writing this, going for about 45 cents per switch, is basically considered to be a switch not worth the premium you pay for switches from the Cherry, the original creator of MX style switches. Let me get something out of the way: I've never tried Cherry MX Browns, so I can't speak to them directly. Gateron Browns, on the other hand, are extremely cheap at 24 cents a switch, but they seem to get just as much shit.

Usually, the argument given to prove that Gateron browns are bad, is that you might as well buy a similarly priced linear, which, they point out, you can. Just buy Gateron Yellows, they say. It's true that in the Gateron lineup, Yellows and Browns have the same MSRP. My initial impression is that the two switches are the same save for the very light tactile bump on the Brown's stems. For tactile-enjoying (specifically light-to medium tactile-enjoying) people like myself, those people who find that linears are missing something, the Browns are usable whereas (I know loads of people like Gat Yellows. I myself did too at first, I say this emphatically from a subjective point of view) the Yellows are unusable, or might as well be, for my purposes.
