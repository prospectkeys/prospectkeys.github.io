As a keyboard enthusiast who spends too much time thinking about, buying, and modding in the search for the perfect switch. As anyone who has had a similar search probably knows there is no such thing as a personal perfect switch. You hopefully get to the ballpark of switches you prefer, or multiple ballparks of switches for different tasks. It's just part of the hobby that you will eventually get tired of things and feel the urge to try one of the onslaught of new switches that are constantly coming out. Tastes are always changing at least for me. It's nice when I find a switch I enjoy using. For me, the most enjoyable switch is not always the one you type fastest or most accurately with.

I've always been a "tactile-gang" member since I joine the hobby. My phases of trying linear switches never lasted. It felt like something was missing, and I came away feeling unsatisfied. On the other hand, hugely tactile switches, like the Boba U4T (big rounded bump) and Kailh Box Royals (sharp clifflike top-travel bump), for me, were too far in the other direction.
