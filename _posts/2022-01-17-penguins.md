I'm always looking for interesting new switches to try, but primarily tactile switches. The Penguin switch is the first switch I have tried from Kinetic Labs. As far as I can tell, it is their flagship tactile offering. Mysteriously to me, it claims "ergo tactility". To understand what that meant, my first idea was that they are trying to make a switch similar to the frankenswitch ergo-clears, as seems to be a distinct trend among switch makers, trying to basically make a one switch solution either trying to emulate or take inspiration from a more expensive frankenswitch.
