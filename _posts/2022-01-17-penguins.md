I'm always looking for interesting new switches to try, but primarily tactile switches. The Penguin switch is the first switch I have tried from Kinetic Labs. As far as I can tell, it is their flagship tactile offering. Mysteriously to me, it claims "ergo tactility". To understand what that meant, my first idea was that they are trying to make a switch similar to the frankenswitch ergo-clears, as seems to be a distinct trend among switch makers, trying to basically make a one switch solution either trying to emulate or take inspiration from a more expensive frankenswitch. I have yet to try Cherry MX Ergo Clear, but from what I have heard they are a more tactile switch made from a slightly too heavy Cherry MX clear, and that basically if someone wanted to use only Cherry switches and have a strong tactile bump, this would be the switch.    

The Penguins come in the adorable Little Penguin (this is actually the name of a specific species of penguin) inspired bag. Altogether, this switch came with some really nice touches I haven't seen unfortunately with other switches. On a little card, Kinetic Labs has given us a mini-guide to using the switch. They say to use no less than a 63 gram spring, and it describes how to lube the switch (saying to lube the legs). I followed their direction and lubed the legs, and I was very happy with the result, which was still plenty tactile. The tactile bump comes mid-stroke. The card also advised using no less than a 67 gram spring for the modifiers. I had the 63.5 gram variant, and used that spring for the modifiers in my Frog TKL. I have had no problems, but I may try using a stronger spring for mods one of these days.

As for my opinion on these switches from using them on my Frog TKL, they are very comfortable at the 63.5 gram spring typing for long spurts and even when gaming, though I would use something lighter for extended gaming. The bump is surprisingly tactile and it feels pretty smooth but also slightly sharp to my feeling. 

###### Compared to Boba U4T

Compared to Boba U4Ts (at the same spring weight) this switch is less tiringly tactile. This may or may not be due to a bigger tactile bump. They both have large ones. The Penguins just feel more easy to use, where the Boba U4T (a great switch by the way) is a little too tactile for me to get into a consistent typing rythymn.
