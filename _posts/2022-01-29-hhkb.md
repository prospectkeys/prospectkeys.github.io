## The HHKB 
#### An Expensive, Light Topre Board

This is to be a mini review of the HHKB Professional S-Type Hybrid. Coming from the world of MX style mechanical keyboards, the HHKB is a little different. If you haven't heard of it, the HHKB is a prebuilt keyboard with Topre, or electric-capacitive switches. The variant I have on hand is the dark grey, "Professional Hybrid Silent" type of board. Hybrid is just referring to it being compatible both wired and with bluetooth. This iteration does come with USB-C rather than Mini-USB, which is a necessary (or welcome, if you're an HHKB veteran) change. 

Feel-wise, it's essentially an expensive rubber-dome keyboard. The all-plastic construction doesn't help me to feel that this is something above those dirt cheap membrane keyboards. You can definitely feel that is mushier than a mechanical keyboard. However, it makes me scatch my head. I like using it and I am not sure whether I'm just trying hard to like it or what. It's not life-changing on first use but it's subtly quite nice. I'm sure lubing will make it feel a little more refined.

Admittedly, the sound is something I hated at first. But I did somewhat grow to like the muted, thuds of the keys. My model has 45g domes, but it feels way heavier if I compare it to MX style switches. My sweet spot with MX is about 62g, but the 45g domes are surprisingly heavy and got me wondering if I should get 35g domes instead.

It feels pretty ok to type on, but I'm having trouble dealing with the thought that it's not different enough from a 15 dollar membrane keyboard. The membrane keyboard I'm used to right now is the one on my Thinkpad T14. This one feels better than that, but that's a laptop keyboard so expectations are higher for this expensive Topre Board. I haven't decided whether to keep it or send it back to Amazon. It has the key-travel of 4mm so that part is to par. To be honest, I like the key feel. The sound is what I'm having trouble with.

The tactility is pretty nice on the Topre switches. I'd say it feels a bit like the Boba U4T. I've never tried Holy Pandas but people say it compares to that. I got it as a travel board and to try out the switches as well as the layout. I have heard that I need to give it a week. I will do that and report back what I learn!
