## Wood 60%

This keyboard has been through many iterations and the latest configuration is certainly not the last. As it is right now, the case is still the Walnut-type wood that came with a GK-64 kit I bought primarily for that case as I wanted a wood case and perhaps to make my own wood cases. It was one of my first purchases in the hobby, and I have reservations about selling it. Not that it's all that valuable. I have removed all but the 4 outer standoffs to cut down on tray-mount hotspots. 

Using that case with O-rings has yielded good but not great sound and feel. The current iteration uses a Wilba.Tech WT60-D WEIRDFLEX PCB, a polycarbonate plate, Mode Designs Signal switches, tape mod, drawer liner and blank grey keycaps. The switches are a sweet spot for me, highly tactile but not overly heavy at 63.5g bottoming out. They are essentially recolored Durock T1s with a slightly lighter spring. The PCB's use of large flex-cuts to isolate the alphas means the alphas feel flexy for a tray mount board.

Though I wouldn't recommend getting to this build the way I did, the tinkering I have done on internal, non-visible parts with this 60% form factor is for me part of what got me deeper into the hobby and was a truly fun process. The outer aesthetic stays the same whle the inside grows to be something more refined and to my liking.
