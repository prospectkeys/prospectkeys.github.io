I am a keyboard builder based out of Oakley, Utah. I do commissioned keyboard builds. 


Welcome! I will build the best luxury keyboard for your individual desires and requirements. I work with artisans and makers throughout the state of Utah and the mountain west, to bring you a unique keyboard that sounds, feels and looks amazing.

## Services

I offer a variety of services:

* Bespoke custom fully built keyboards - I will work with you every step of the way to get you the keyboard of your dreams. 
* Building parted out keyboards - I will take parts you have selected and shipped to me for me to build and if you want, add some unique finishing touches. 
* Switch Tuning - I will use my process of lubing, tuning, modding, and customizing switches to your particular tastes.
* Consultation - I will do no-cost consultations with you whenever you commission a product. Due to logistics they will probably be virtual. I will consult with you for a fee, outside of any commission, or for a reduced fee after a commision project has ended.
